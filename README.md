# Cypher-Keyboard
An Android keyboard that puts each typed character through a pseudo-random cypher, and can decrypt encrypted text with the key.
Useful for encoded texts between friends, or enterprise messages if replaced with enterprise-level encryption.

Enable the keyboard in Android Settings, and in Android 5.0 Lollipop+, switch to "SimpleIME"
using the software key on the bottom right when typing.

To decode, highlight the encoded text and press "Dec."
